# Awarify

  I am trying to build an app using which people can view, share and comment on verified news. The news is currently being fetched from an API, https://newsapi.org/ (if anyone has better suggesstions, please do tell, because this API has a daily limit of 100 requests ;-;)


  This is still a Work In Progress, and I have a long way to go, and a lot of stuff is yet to be implemented, but hopefully I will be able to do it properly. Attaching a screenshot of the main screen below-
